This is an Android App that manages a list of breweries and their available beers across multiple users.
It is currently unter development and not yet usable.
The app should feature maps of brewery locations, a beer rating system and many additional features to keep track of the beers 
you and your buddies tasted.
Google Firebase is used to manage the database and users.
